User instructions to synthesize a supervisor for the basic model of the Eerste Heinenoordtunnel and perform simulations with the synthesized supervisor.

1. Download repository from GitHub.
    - Go to https://github.com/LMoormann/Eerste-Heinenoordtunnel
    - Click on "Clone or download"
    - Click on "Download ZIP"
    - Unzip the contents of the package

2. Import the model in CIF 3.
    - CIF 3 can be downloaded from: http://update.se.wtb.tue.nl/documentation/install/bundled-ide.html
    - Install and open CIF via Eclipse.exe.
    - Click on "File", "Import...", "General", "Existing Projects into Workspace", "Next".
    - Select the "CIF Models" directory downloaded from GitHub as the root directory via "Browse".
    - Select "Eerste Heinenoordtunnel" and click "Finish".
    - In the Package Explorer window the project will now be visible.
    
3. Optional: Synthesize a new supervisor.
    - Open "Basic Model/Supervisor/Synthesis.tooldef2".
    - Right click in the file, select "Execute ToolDef..."
    - In the option Window click on Finish.
    - If the synthesis is successful the created supervisor can be found at "Basic Model/Supervisor/generated_files/MonolithicSupervisor.cif".
    - Details for the synthesis algorithm are provided at: http://cif.se.wtb.tue.nl/tools/datasynth.html.
    
4. Simulate a supervisor.
    - Open "Basic Model/Simulation.tooldef2."
    - Right click in the file, select "Execute ToolDef..."
    - In the option Window click on Finish.
    - The simulation will start, clicking on the buttons will generate commands.
    - Details for the simulation are provided at: http://cif.se.wtb.tue.nl/tools/cif3sim/index.html.
